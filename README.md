[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/jenkinsci/hackfest.svg)](https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hackfest?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

This repository contains a new dark theme for Jenkins which is currently **under development**.
It requires changes in the Jenkins core, and it is not ready for production use.
Visualization is also not perfect, contributions are welcome!

## Usage

The theme is designed to be used with the [Simple Theme Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/simple-theme-plugin/).
See the plugin documentation for theme installation guidelines.

* The theme was created as a part of the [Jenkins UI/UX Hackfest](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ui-ux-hackfest-2020) on May 25-29, 2020.
* The theme is inspired by the [camalot/jenkins-dark-stylish](https://github.com/camalot/jenkins-dark-stylish) theme, but it is a new theme created by scratch.
